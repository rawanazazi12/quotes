# Quotes 

## Lab08 - OO Design and GSON

In this lab, I've used bufferedreader to read a JSON file and then, parse the JSON file using GSON and convert it to a java class to get the data of quote's author and text.

### Overview

* Using GSON library to parse the json file.
* Create a Quotes class and a quotes constructor:
   1. String author
   2. String text
* **BufferedReader** : to read file data line by line
